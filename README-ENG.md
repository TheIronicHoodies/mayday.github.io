---------------------------------------

A. PURPOSE

Mayday: A Voyage Through Space is an interactive web serial hosted via GitHub that allows its readers to vote for the next chapter based on a point character. Readers are given 1 week to vote, and are not allowed to change their vote after submission. The following rules are given in addition via the HOME page:

1. "After winning, a crew member cannot be voted for in the next round. This means no crew member can win twice in a row." This rule is implemented to give chances for those who wish to see the perspectives of other characters in the case that one were to win the majority vote several rounds in a row.

2. "If a crew member is asleep, unconscious, or deceased by the time the next chapter starts, they are ineligible to win." 

3. "Ineligible crew members won't always immediately be removed as a poll option." This ensures that readers will not be spoiled should a character have been killed or rendered unconscious outside the currently published chapters. Therefore, should a reader vote for an ineligible, yet selectable character, their vote will be rendered NULL.

4. "If two or more crew members tie for the vote, one will be chosen at random."

5. "Poll statistics will only be revealed once The A-2020 has reached its destination." This ensures a sense of anonymity and comfort, and allows readers to vote in future chapters with less influence from conformity and/or peer pressure.

B. HOME

HOME contains the premise and rules of the web serial. It also secondarily contains a hyperlink to the latest chapter for quicker access, and any important updates should they arise.

The twelve MAYDAYs in the page header fade one by one when characters are revealed to have died.

C. CHAPTER LIST

CHAPTER LIST is a navigation page for all published chapters. They may be sorted by character through List view, or sorted by number through Grid view. At the top is a link to the latest released chapter for easier navigation. 

The header contains a countdown to the next chapter. The site does not automatically update upon reaching zero, and chapters may not release as soon as the countdown reaches 0:00:00:00. However, it does prevent further, 'late' votes from entering the system.
