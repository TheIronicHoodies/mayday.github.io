                <p class="start">The Doctor opened the hatch to the common room, and ambled in only to lean against the wall next to the Economist. "Sorry, can you all give me some space? Thanks."</p>
                <p>"Doc, we heard about what happened to The Captain," cried The Professor, who faced her. "Will he—"</p>
                <p>"He's not gonna make it," said The Doctor. "I've... accepted it. There's nothing that can be done to save him."</p>
                <p>"What?" gasped The Journalist.</p>
                <p>"He's not?" repeated The Engineer, lounging on the edge of the couch as The Professor, who was next to him, watched. "What exactly do you mean by that?"</p>
                <p>"He ingested cyanide," The Doctor stated. "There were lethal traces of it in his blood. Chef, what did you drink last night?”</p>
                <p>"I don't think I drank anything besides water. Why?"</p>
                <p>"I remember The Captain asking for tea. You made his, right?"</p>
                <p>The Journalist stood up. "Chef—"</p>
                <p>"If The Chef was poisoned as well, I don’t see why it would be her," The Detective objected. "Nor does she have any motive or reason, nor is it in her nature, to kill The Captain. It would be anyone <i>but</i> her."</p>
                <p>The Doctor pulled on her coat's collar. "I'm not in the mood to start accusing anybody, but..."</p>
                <p>"It means that there is an assassin among us," said The Detective. He faced the rest of the crew from the opposite end of the room.</p>
                <p>"Doctor, you should stay in your room if that's going to make you feel better," suggested The Chef as she walked towards her. "I—"</p>
                <p>"Can you explain how cyanide got into his tea?"</p>
                <p>"I didn't do anything!" she said. "Well, I… did know the tea tasted off, because I... took a sip. Just a tiny sip. But I didn’t think it was poison, why would I?"</p>
                <p>"And then you served it to The Captain, and in a few minutes you vomited and fell on the floor," said The Professor.</p>
                <p>"Mhm. And then he asked for tea again this morning, just before roll call—"</p>
                <p>"Doc, how’d you cure <i>her</i>?"</p>
                <p>"Hydroxocobalamin—in other words, vitamin B-12 supplements. It’s a well-known antidote," she said. "The Captain is comatose, and the only way I can introduce it to his bloodstream is via IV — problem is, we only have it in the form of tablets. At least The Chef was half-awake so I could feed her."</p>
                <p>"There’s no other way?"</p>
                <p>"I'm afraid not. Second best treatment would be oxygen therapy, but dare I tamper with The 2020’s oxygen systems just to cure an old geezer who’s probably dead by now?"</p>
                <p>"Well, ye—"</p>
                <p>"No, of course not, unless you want to die right now, Professor," she scoffed.</p>
                <p>"So who did it?" The Journalist asked. "Was it you, Detective? Or—"</p>
                <p>"You’re only making yourself look more suspicious, Journalist," The Economist pointed out . "Let’s not accuse anyone here without concrete evidence first."</p>
                <p>"I can't imagine there'd be much concrete evidence to work with for cyanide poisoning—"</p>
                <p>"Wait, before any of that!" shouted The Professor as she started walking around the room, with a small tear coming down her right eye. "If The Captain won't survive, then who will lead us?" she promptly stated in confidence, facing the rest of the crew. "There's only one solution! For those born on The 2020, I know this is your first time participating, but I'll cut straight to the point: We'll elect a new leader!"</p>
                <p>"Elect?" asked The Athlete. "What does that mean?"</p>
                <p>"Each person votes who they want as the new leader," The Professor explained. "We'll count the votes for each person, and whoever has the most is the new Captain. It's simple!"</p>
                <p>"Simple… That is, until you factor in candidates lying," muttered The Detective.</p>
                <p>"I want The Engineer to lead us," said The Athlete. "He's the one who saved us from the asteroid this morning!"</p>
                <p>"No, but isn't The Pilot the one that steered the ship?" countered The Musician. "Oh, no, wait—"</p>
                <p>"We barely even speak to The Pilot," said The Doctor. "Guys, can we—"</p>
                <p>"And, it's The Professor that's the exact reason why The Pilot knew where to steer," refuted The Journalist. "I think she’s our best bet."</p>
                <p>"But isn’t The Detective the smartest on board?"</p>
                <p>"I’m flattered, but that's a subjective claim, Chef," sighed The Detective. "And, I'd like to ask, may I abstain?"</p>
                <p>"Abstain?" The Professor repeated. "Why?"</p>
                <p>"I don't think we need a leader," The Detective stated. "We're all meant to thrive, aren't we? How are we going to thrive if we have a person above us? We're all going to lead ourselves. That is how we thrive."</p>
                <p>The Professor swallowed. "Then let me promise that if I am elected captain, we will have no leader, and we'll all get to live in a lawless utopia!"</p>
                <p>"That—" The Engineer stuttered. "That doesn't work out logically."</p>
                <p>"Think of it this way," she said. "As the new captain, I would have the power to <i>abolish</i> the role of captain, and everyone gets to go free."</p>
                <p>"Hush, hush, Prof," said The Detective. "That is <i>exactly</i> why I wish to abstain—"</p>
                <p>"And for you five younglings, what do you think?"</p>
                <p>"Professor, I highly advise you think this through," said The Doctor. "What you're pulling now was always what caused our shit to happen. It happened on Earth—God forbid you let that continue here."</p>
                <p>The Chef tilted her head. "What do you guys mean?"</p>
                <p>The Economist sighed. "Long story short, people with an agenda, such as our old Professor, will do anything to get that done. They will make promises, appeal to those who don't know better, and grow in power until everyone's screwed."</p>
                <p>"I... don't think I'm familiar with what The Economist said, since I was born here on The 2020, but I think he makes sense. I'm sorry, Professor."</p>
                <p>She rolled her eyes and looked upwards. "Fine, guess you win. But the point stands: We're all fine with having no leader, right?"</p>
                <p>"I’m fine with any decision as long as nobody slacks off and ultimately gets us all killed," said The Detective.</p>
                <p>"I still want you to lead us," said The Chef, looking at The Professor. "I mean, you're not the kind of person that The Economist described, right? You have the same goal as all of us."</p>
                <p>"That's true," said The Soldier.</p>
                <p>The Doctor turned around. "It's not that I don't trust The Professor, but it doesn't hurt to want you all to put more thought into who will or won't be in charge for the next decades to come."</p>
                <p>"I was thinking about voting for The Engineer," stated The Professor. "He has more potential than I do. He's just as smart as I am, but younger, too."</p>
                <p>"That boy's overworked as is," said The Economist. "Are you sure that's what you want, Professor?"</p>
                <p>"A large part of engineering falls in managing a team," said The Professor. "And he'll do just fine getting us to work as a team—"</p>
                <p>"Let me be frank, Professor, I never had the highest of standards for you these days—but you've hit a new low," said The Detective. The Professor placed her hand over her nose, as if to think; in reality, underneath, she was smiling.</p>
                <p>"Anyhow, I'll pass," replied The Engineer. "Doing what The Captain did seems so… robotic. What does he even do all day?"</p>
                <p>"It doesn't have to be the way The Captain did it," noted The Musician. "Right?"</p>
                <p>"It doesn't," confirmed The Doctor. "By the way, who <i>exactly</i> are our candidates?"</p>
                <p>"Anyone, as of the moment," admitted The Professor. "There's just a few of us, so there's no need to nominate."</p>
                <p>The Doctor looked around. "Detective, you have a degree in law, yes?"</p>
                <p>"Naturally. That and a degree in psychology—"</p>
                <p>"Then you have my vote, sir," she sighs. "And frankly, I don't see why he doesn't have more votes. He's the one whose job is on standby until dumb shit happens, yet he has the credentials for the job. You're voting for The Professor because she taught you that the Earth wasn't flat when you were children."</p>
                <p>"And I have an objection, Doc," said The Professor. "You think I have things to do these days but get crammed in the tech room with The Engineer? No, of course not! And what makes you think I can't handle The Captain's old shit?"</p>
                <p>"I have nothing against you personally, Professor, but I just don't think you're in any good position to lead—you and I both know the reason why," said The Doctor right before she stood up.</p>
                <p>"Where are you going, Doc?" asked The Chef.</p>
                <p>"Back to bed. I'm tired, you know," she answered.</p>
                <p>"So the tally so far is two on me, and one each for The Professor, Detective, and Pilot," The Engineer enumerated. "But I doubt if The Musician's vote is valid, considering The Pilot isn't eligible."</p>
                <p>"Then I'm not sure who to vote for," said The Musician. "Is there a reason we couldn't have The Captain's work split up among several people instead?"</p>
                <p>"I don't see why not, either," The Detective chuckled. "He didn't seem to do much, but if there was anything of importance that he was doing, I would gladly take the job of managing it." He paused and held the side of his forehead. "Speaking of, doesn't The Pilot have the right to vote as well?"</p>
                <p>"I'll go get his vote," The Athlete volunteered; she left no time for objections.</p>
                <p>"Here's my take," said The Economist. "I don't trust The Professor with making any critical decisions either, but The Detective's never upset me with his. Since The Professor seems to be very eager to usurp the role for herself, how about we have The Detective as our new Captain with The Professor as his vice?"</p>
                <p>"I don't want to be Captain," spoke The Professor. "Well, I'll take it if that's what people want, but—"</p>
                <p>"Bad idea," said The Economist. "If you're looking for more work to do, why not go to the kitchen and take over The Chef's job while she continues to recover, hm?"</p>
                <p>"I said I can handle it," The Chef gaffed. "I feel a lot better now, sheesh!"</p>
                <p>"So, what's the consensus now, exactly?" asked The Professor. "The Detective leads while I bundle up in the office during my off-time? I'm half-jobless, so I'm up for it."</p>
                <p>"I… I think so," said The Musician. "Yeah. But The Pilot's vote?"</p>
                <p>The Engineer fixed his glasses. "No, at this point it doesn't matter."</p>
                <p>"What if he has something else to say?" The Journalist replied. "Why don't you think—"</p>
                <p>"The Pilot?" blurted The Musician. "That'd be news to me!"</p>
                <p>"True, I highly doubt he would have much to say," said The Detective. "At most, he'll speak through his vote."</p>
                <p>The Engineer pointed forward.</p>
                <p>"Detective!" The Athlete shouted. "He voted... for The Detective!"</p>
                <p>The Professor patted her hip. "You'd have saved a lot more energy just trying to radio him. He always has the thing on."</p>
                <p>"No matter. It seems this is all settled," said The Detective.</p>
                <p>"Alrighty, then!" The Professor piped. "All in favour, shout aye-yay!"</p>
                <p>"It's just 'aye'," The Economist corrected.</p>
                <p>"Whoops! Sorry!"</p>
                <p>"Aye!"</p>
                <p>The Detective stood up with a proud stance and looked at the clock. "It's nearly eleven. Chef, you know what that means—"</p>
                <p>The Chef swallowed. "I'm on it, sir!"</p>
                <p>"No need for formalities like that. I'm not like the last leader you had, who cared about his authority so much," he said. "And that extends to all of you."</p>
                <p>"So is The Captain really not—"</p>
                <p>"You heard The Doctor, didn't you?" The Economist interrupted. "The Captain won't be here anymore. He's comatose. He's as good as dead by now."</p>
                <p>"I… I see."</p>
                <p>"I understand it seems sudden for you, Chef, but today was something I've been waiting for," said The Economist. "His leadership was inefficient and unsuitable for our context, nuff said."</p>
                <p>"Indeed, I too disagreed with our late Captain," agreed The Detective. "Same reasons as you. I don't understand why he'd implement such rules."</p>
                <p>"Maybe he just wanted to keep us in order," said The Professor. "His methods… weren't the best. But it was his job. The Engineer and I talk about, well, his father's uncommented code. The Athlete runs errands. The Musician plays the guitar each Sunday. The Chef cooks our meals. But what's The Captain gonna do when everyone else is busy? Don't get me wrong, I agree with both of you. But if the twelve—sorry, <i>eleven</i> of us are going to survive, then we not only have to work together but also understand each other. Got it, everyone?"</p>
                <p>"THAT'S MY PROFESSOR!" exclaimed a smiling Engineer, standing from his seat, fist high in the air.</p>
                <p>"Professor, I think you and The Detective should talk with The Captain," suggested The Musician. "You know, so that you know what to do? He's still alive, isn't he?"</p>
                <p>"Oh, sorry!" The Chef apologized, moving by the gateway. The Detective gave no reaction but a blink and a rub on his nose with his gloved hands.</p>
                <div class="scenebreak">|||│▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░│|||</div>
                <p class="start">The Professor clapped. "So, time to see the shit the last US President left behind for us to work with."</p>
                <p>"I'm a little afraid, actually," said The Detective.</p>
                <p>"You?" she laughed. "Afraid of what? The monster under Nick's desk?"</p>
                <p>"Never mind that," he spoke. "Let's go."</p>
                <p>When they came into the room, as expected, it was in shambles from the ship's shaking. His chair was beside his desk, not behind it; the computer's mouse had fallen off, and even the padlocks on the drawers were broken.</p>
                <p>"What a shitty lock," remarked The Detective. He stuck his hand in; there was a brown folder and nothing else. He didn't hesitate to open and skim through it right away.</p>
                <p>"What's inside?"</p>
                <p>He swiftly closed it. "All I'll say is... it's a remarkable thing he's had hidden this whole time," he smiled. "We'll talk about it after breakfast."</p>
                <p>"Can't you give a brief—"</p>
                <p>"It's about all of us," he said. "Now if you have time to ask, then you also have time to be a good vice captain and do me a favor."</p>
                <p>"W-What kind of favor?"</p>
                <p>He rubbed his chin. "Keep an extra eye on The Doctor for me, will you?"</p>
                <p>The Professor grinned. "I've always wanted to get even with that woman. Tell me everything you know."</p>
