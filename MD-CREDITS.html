            <p>Hi! I'm Levi Ann Lawson. I'm a tech nerd by day, and a psych horror writer with too many stories in their head by night. I'm a cool and chill guy... I think.</p>
            <p>I started writing Mayday during NaNoWriMo 2020. Though I didn't hit the goal in time, I had lots of fun with it. The project has now been revived in this form, where people can vote for chapters and characters they like. I've always liked to marry my interests together, and found that this site, <i>Mayday: A Voyage Through Space</i> was the perfect way to do it.</p>
            <p>I'm a broke bloke on his first year in college, and I built this website on a virtually zero budget. Still, I know other people need money more than I do. If you wish to leave a tip, please consider donating to a charity instead.</p>
