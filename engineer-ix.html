                <p class="start">He stretched his arms wide out in the darkness. He yawned awake.</p>
                <p>He shuffled off the stiff, flat, white mattress, and stepped around for his boots. He swept his messy hair aside, and stood up.</p>
                <p>“What time is it...? Everyone's asleep…”</p>
                <p>He slowly crept out of the quarters, trying not to disturb anyone. Then, he went out the hatch and exited the room. “What should I do...? I'm a bit hungry…”</p>
                <p>“Darn, The Professor was right…”</p>
                <p>He peered into the dining hall, where there was light and clattering noise. Was he really out for that long?</p>
                <p>He walked into the kitchen. "Chef?"</p>
                <p>"Engineer!" The Chef blurted. "Finally, you're awake! Would you like to try something new for dinner?"</p>
                <p>"Something new?"</p>
                <p>"Yes. The Doctor told me about instant food, and I wanted to tell you all about it. I didn't think such a thing existed!"</p>
                <p>"Instant food? What does that even mean?"</p>
                <p>"Come!" She hurried to the kitchen; she was almost too excited.</p>
                <p>He followed along. "Ah, you'll... demonstrate it to me?"</p>
                <p>"It's not <i>instant</i> instant, but it saves a lot of work," she said. "Could you pour water into the boiler?"</p>
                <p>"How much?"</p>
                <p>"Any amount does as long as you don't spill."</p>
                <p>He paused. "That seems fair."</p>
                <p>"Yup!"</p>
                <p>He put down the jug. "What next?"</p>
                <p>"We... wait," she said. "Why don't you sit down for a bit?"</p>
                <p>"How long will it take?"</p>
                <p>"A few minutes to boil, and a few more just to simmer down," she said; she was reading words from a very strange and colorful round container. That was enough time to make a round to the tech room and grab the tablet.</p>
                <p>The Engineer pulled a chair and sat. He wrote the following:</p>
                <i>
                    <p>Instant food not literally instant. Chef's account: Saves time. Somehow, food can be prepared just by boiling water (impossible)</p>
                    <p>Food is pre-prepared and packaged in a container the size of a human hand (approx. 9.8 cm wide). Hypothesis: Instant food cannot be as fulfilling, delicious, or nutritious as normal food.</p>
                    <p>Three food groups: Protein-rich (meat), mineral-rich, carbohydrate-rich</p>
                    <p>Meat takes ~30 minutes to cook thoroughly. (clearly not instant). Vegetables, from what I remember, take about as much time to cut and cook. Instant food = starchy. Unbalanced but would agree with the established inference.</p>
                    <p>Hypothesis: I can offset this by introducing a chemical that contains the necessary nutritional components. I have not indulged in chemistry in a while, so I will have to request The Doctor's assistance.</p>
                </i>
                <p>The Chef was carrying a large cup half-filled with hot, steaming, aromatic water with a loose yellow tangle of starchy threads sunken inside. What were those?</p>
                <p>“Hope it tastes alright,” she said, serving it in front of him. “Careful, it’s still a little hot.” She blowed exactly thrice.</p>
                <p>“Yeah, I can see that—”</p>
                <p>“I… should confess,” The Chef admitted. “I've never tasted that yet, so I hope it’s alright.”</p>
                <p>The Engineer raised his fork and twirled a slop of the food he’d been given, much unlike what he’d ever seen before, and carried it to his mouth.</p>
                <p>"How is it?"</p>
                <p>"How did you make this in less than ten minutes?"</p>
                <p>"The food comes pre-packaged. See? It's on the lid," she said. "Then all that's left to do is pour hot water."</p>
                <p>"So it was—" he stuttered. "Wait, this is from Earth?"</p>
                <p>"Yup."</p>
                <p>"This is <i>decades</i> old, Chef! Why would you—"</p>
                <p>"Hey, calm down! It was made to last this long," she said. "It should taste sour if it's off, I think."</p>
                <p>"You <i>think</i>?"</p>
                <p>"I don't want to see for myself!" she fussed and grumbled. "Well, fine. I'll have one. Just one."</p>
                <p>He slurped a strand. "Chef!"</p>
                <p>"H-Huh?"</p>
                <p>"Is there any proof that all food will taste sour when it's expired?" he shouted. "For one, these are hurting my tongue."</p>
                <p>"You're so funny, you know?"</p>
                <p>"You think this is a joke?"</p>
                <p>"No! That's called spice," said The Chef. "It's a kind of taste. You really didn't know it was a thing?"</p>
                <p>"Why... would something like this be on board?"</p>
                <p>"It's not harmful! It goes away in a bit," she said. "Should I get water for you?"</p>
                <p>"I can get water myself, thanks," he said. "How do you know about this... spice?"</p>
                <p>She squeezed her shoulders. "I... don't know. I remember watching some man making food there in the kitchen when I was younger, and he explained how different tastes work. Thinking about it... his food tasted really good."</p>
                <p>"That must've been The Chef before you."</p>
                <p>She nodded. "How's it?"</p>
                <p>"I'm relieved," he said. "I'm... starting to like it, actually."</p>
                <p>"I'm glad to hear that," she said. "You know... you missed a lot while you were asleep."</p>
                <p>"Really? What happened?"</p>
                <p>"A... shit ton," she answered; for some reason, she kept rubbing her left cheek. "For one, Maria cooked dinner!"</p>
                <p>"Maria?"</p>
                <p>"Oh, right. Maria's The Doctor," she said. "Dr. Maria Sinclair!"</p>
                <p>"Oh!" he said. "So we're finally using real names, huh?"</p>
                <p>"I'm Jill!" The Chef exclaimed. "I... don't know your name, though—"</p>
                <p>"That's okay. I'll find out tomorrow."</p>
                <p>"Later," she corrected. "It's one in the morning."</p>
                <p>"And you haven't slept?"</p>
                <p>"I'm flattered you care that much, but I had a nap around the same time you did. As long as we get eight hours of sleep... something something,"  Don't worry about my sleep schedule."</p>
                <p>He exhaled. "Thinking about it—"</p>
                <p>"Yeah?"</p>
                <p>"I assume The Doctor's treated you already," he said. "But your left cheek's become a little purple. That only happens when small blood vessels rupture, often caused by—"</p>
                <p>"Really, you're funny. Why didn't you just say the word 'bruise'?" she asked. "The Economist hit me."</p>
                <p>"Why?"</p>
                <p>"He's a murderer!"</p>
                <p>He sighed. "I hope you're fine now." </p>
                <p>"It only swells up a little every now and then," she said. "Thanks for looking out for me. As you always have!"</p>
                <p>"Do I? I'm always in the tech room. Recently, I haven't been joining the Sunday jams—"</p>
                <p>"I meant when we were younger," she said. "Remember when there were used to be so many other kids? We were all crammed into the tech room—at some point, she taught us in the halls, didn't she?"</p>
                <p>"I remember, yes."</p>
                <p>"We always worked together, didn't we?"</p>
                <p>"I do remember that," he said. "You had trouble trying to solve quadratic equations, and I was always assisting you... for some reason."</p>
                <p>She was silent—then her lips pursed. "You like me, don't you?"</p>
                <p>"Like you how?"</p>
                <p>She twirled a slop of noodles with her fork. "Like you'd want to get spicy with me someday."</p>
                <p>"I don't think I follow."</p>
                <p>She palmed the table and bit her lip. "I'll be in the kitchen if you need anything, 'kay? If you're done, just hand me your cup and fork. Love you!"</p>
